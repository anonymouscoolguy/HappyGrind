## Importance of user documentation

### What is user documentation?

User documentation is any document that explains how to use features and functions of a system to its end-users.

Making an analogy, if you ever put together an _IKEA_ furniture, you've used end-user documentation. The pieces that come in the box are part of a complex system, which is extremely hard to build without a simple user documentation.

#### Internal documentation

As the name suggest, this type of documentation is only for internal use, and is the explanation of the **source code**. A complete internal documentation includes:

- Relevant comments
- Meaningful variable names
- Appropriate code indentation
- Appropriate code structure

This type of documentation is **not** meant for the final-user, but instead only for other developers working on the project.

#### External documentation

External documentation usually consists of user guides, software requirements and sometimes includes a detailed description of the design and implementation features of the program. This type of documentation is generally written for the **end-user/customer**.

### Why is user documentation important?

**Users are not developers.** Software and systems may become increasingly complex as they evolve, additionally the user's way of thinking may differ from the developers'. So, user documentation should be kept _simple_, _detailed_ and _systematic_ to ensure that the user is able to use the system to a full capacity.

## Different methods of providing user documentation

<details><summary>Integrated User Assistance 🖥️</summary>
<p>

Files supplied together with the system. They can usually be called up with a button in the system.

**Advantages**:

- Accessible at any time when using the program.
- Gives general instructions on how to use the system.
- Gives general instructions on how to solve some major errors.

**Disadvantages**:

- They can only be used after system has been installed.
- They don't give any help when installing the solution.
- They often only deal with very general errors.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Online Support 🌐</summary>
<p>

Special web service hosted by the system's developer to provide user documentation.

**Advantages**:

- They are often extensive compared to help files.
- They get continuously revised by the systems developer to deal with the problems occurring most often (FAQs).
- They often provide an option for live support, talking to a real human operator if a problem arises which the user documentation has no answer to.
- They often have search capabilities built-in so that users can easily search through them.

**Disadvantages**:

- They are useless if users have no internet connection.
- Live support does not work quite well with users unfamiliar with computers when they have to explain their problem (“I clicked 'that' button and then something happened!”).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Printed Manuals 📖</summary>
<p>

Manuals printed on paper and supplied together with the system.

**Advantages**:

- They can be read through by users before starting to work with the new system.
- Always available.
- Gives help installing the system.

**Disadvantages**:

- Can be lost / misplaced / limited in number.
- Often limited to a little booklet supplying little information apart from how to install the system.
- Can't be updated every time the system is updated.

## Different methods of delivering user training

Training end-users in using a new system is very important as productivity greatly depends on how familiar they are with a system.

_User training_ can be delivered in a number of different ways depending on a variety of factors, such as number of students, the availability of instructors, the size of the business, and the training budget.

<details><summary>Self-Instruction 👨‍🎓</summary>
<p>

Users can learn how to use a new system on their own, provided they have the right material to learn from.

**Advantages**:

- Lowest cost – only materials needed, no teachers/buildings.
- Flexible timeline.
- Training tailored to exactly what users wants to learn.

**Disadvantages**:

- With no guidance, user might feel lost/overwhelmed.
- Unstructured learning means certain features might be misunderstood/ignored.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Formal Classes 👩🏻‍🏫</summary>
<p>

This is the type of training where the students are sitting in a classroom listening to an instructor who shows and explains how to use the system.

**Advantages**:

- Structured learning environment.
- Expert on hand to answer questions.
- Curriculum designed to teach all aspects, including ones that might be misunderstood or difficult to grasp.

**Disadvantages**:

- Expensive – teachers, buildings and facilities needed.
- Rigid schedule and curriculum.
- Not much personalisation possible.
